# Sensess Yentzer's Portfolio/Website

### Description:
This weeks challenge is to build my own personal website using the skills that I learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables. I was tasked to ensure that my website has the following: 
1. Developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
2. Links in the navigation that when clicked scrolls to the corresponding section
3. Links in project section that allows for the UI to scroll to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
4. Images of the applications allow for user to be taken to the deployed application when clicked
5. Users are able to resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices and presented with a responsive layout that adapts different viewports
